# OneChain  

Visualising of a simple chain of particle using LAMMPS  
-------------------------------------------------------  
Brief desciption of included file:  
onechain.dat: it is includes specification of the system as a standard file of LAMMPS. The type of particles, their interation types, and required value for calculation.  
freespce: This file is a standard LAMMPS command file to run simulation for desired condition.  
log.lammps: It is a log file an executaion.  
dump.xyz: It is the output of the simulation, including the positions of particles at different timesteps which is necessary for visualization.  
Using VMD anyone can watch the system in desired time.
